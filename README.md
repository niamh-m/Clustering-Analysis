# Clustering-Analysis


Dataset 1: fashion_mnist.csv
This dataset refers to 28×28 pixel images of 10 fashion items

Number of Instances: 10,000
Number of Variables: 784 independent variables + 1 label variable
Each row represents an image. Each independent variable represents a pixel (with value
between 0-255). Label variable indicates which fashion item the image corresponds to:
• 0= T-shirt/top
• 1= Trouser
• 2= Pullover
• 3= Dress
• 4= Coat
• 5= Sandal
• 6= Shirt
• 7= Sneaker
• 8= Bag
• 9= Ankle boot

Project aim:
Visualize natural groupings or clusters in fashion_mnist.csv on an interactive scatter plot by
implementing UMAP dimensionality reduction algorithm in Python. On hovering over any data
point in the plot, one should be able to read the label in the tooltip. 



Dataset 2: reviews.csv
This dataset contains customer reviews of several medicines used to treat four conditions –
acne, insomnia, back pain, and vitamin D deficiency. Depending on medicines’ perceived
effectiveness, customers have given medicines either ‘High’ or ‘Low’ rating. 

Project aim:
Visualize customer reviews on an interactive scatter plot by implementing UMAP
dimensionality reduction algorithm in Python. Visualise any natural groupings of reviews.
On hovering over any data point in the plot, one should be able to read
relevant information about that datapoint in the tooltip.
