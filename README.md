# Clustering-Analysis


Dataset: fashion_mnist.csv
This dataset refers to 28×28 pixel images of 10 fashion items

Number of Instances: 10,000
Number of Variables: 784 independent variables + 1 label variable
Each row represents an image. Each independent variable represents a pixel (with value
between 0-255). Label variable indicates which fashion item the image corresponds to:
• 0= T-shirt/top
• 1= Trouser
• 2= Pullover
• 3= Dress
• 4= Coat
• 5= Sandal
• 6= Shirt
• 7= Sneaker
• 8= Bag
• 9= Ankle boot

Project aim:
Visualize natural groupings or clusters in fashion_mnist.csv on an interactive scatter plot by
implementing UMAP dimensionality reduction algorithm in Python. On hovering over any data
point in the plot, one should be able to read the label in the tooltip.
